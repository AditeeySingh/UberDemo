## 🚕 Uber Demo Backend API

Spring Boot + MongoDB + JWT Authentication

This project is a backend REST API for a mini Ride Sharing application built using Spring Boot, MongoDB, and JWT Authentication.

It supports:
	•	User & Driver authentication
	•	Ride booking by User
	•	Ride request viewing by Driver
	•	Ride accepting by Driver
	•	Ride completion by User or Driver
	•	Advanced ride search & filtering
	•	Analytics using MongoDB Aggregation



🔐 Authentication Flow
	1.	User or Driver registers
	2.	Login returns a JWT Token
	3.	This token must be sent in every request using:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```
